# StepperComponent - E-Commerce Website

## Overview

This project is part of an e-commerce website developed using **Angular 18**. The application features a **stepper component**, which is used to guide users through various stages, such as product selection, cart management, and checkout. The application is built with the goal of providing a user-friendly shopping experience.

For the backend, **JSON Web Server** is used to simulate a REST API, allowing for mock data handling and reducing the need for a fully-fledged backend during development.
